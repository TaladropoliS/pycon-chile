# Sets are lists without order

all_fruits = {'🍎', '🍏', '🍋', '🍊'}

# all_fruits.add('🍍') # at the end
# all_fruits.add('🍍') # at the end
# Sets cannot have duplicates!

# all_fruits.add(['👁', '👄']) # Sets cannot have mutable items!

# print(all_fruits)

# Why sets?
# - Sets are slower than lists but guaranty inmutable items and avoid duplicates.
# - Order don't matter
