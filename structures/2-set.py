# Sets are lists without order

fruits = {'🍎', '🍏', '🍋', '🍊'}

# fruits.add('🍍') # at the end
# fruits.add('🍍') # at the end
# Sets cannot have duplicates!

# fruits.add(['👁', '👄']) # Sets cannot have mutable items!

print(fruits)

# Why sets?
# Sets are slower than lists but guaranty inmutable items and avoid duplicates.
